NOTE: 

-- I  WORKED WITH ANOTHER PERSON TO CREATE ALL VHDL FILES UNDER THE FOLDER EECE351(since it was for a class), feel free to check out his linkedin as well: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pritchet/ 


-- To navigate to VHDL files, click on the folder, go to [foldername].srcs, then either sources_1 (will appear if there are multiple VHDL files) or utils_1(if there are multiple VHDL files, this will appear after sources_1 is clicked), then imports, and then synth_1, all            files will be located there. 

-- All VHDL files are/will be written in VHDL 2008
