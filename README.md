NOTE1: THE VHDL FILES UNDER (eece351) WERE WORKED ON WITH ANOTHER PERSON(since it was for a class), feel free to check out his linkedin as well: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pritchet/ 


To navigate to VHDL files, click on the folder, go to [foldername].srcs, then either sources_1 (will appear if there are multiple VHDL files) or utils_1(if there are multiple VHDL files, this will appear after sources_1 is clicked), then imports, and then synth_1, all files will be located there.
