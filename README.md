NOTE: THE REASON WHY GITHUB IS SAYING THIS REPO'S PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS TCL IS BECAUSE THE LINGUIST LIBRARY IS DETECTING EXTRA FILES FROM VIVADO, THE MAIN LANGUAGE IS VHDL
To navigate to VHDL files, click on the folder, go to [foldername].srcs, then either sources_1 (will appear if there are multiple VHDL files) or utils_1(if there are multiple VHDL files, this will appear second), then imports, and then synth_1, all files will be located there
